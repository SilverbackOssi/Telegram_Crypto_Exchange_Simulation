## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**

The code uses Django models to define the `Wallet` and `Transaction` models, which represent the user's wallet and transaction records, respectively. The models are related to the `User` model, which stores user information such as the Telegram user ID and username.

The code also includes error handling mechanisms such as custom exceptions (`InsufficientFundsError`), input validation, and exception handling for API requests.
